const AboutUs = () => {
    <div>At our coffee shop, coffee isn't just a drink: it's an experience, a moment to share, a break in the day, an excuse to come together.
We love the aroma of freshly ground coffee, the sound of the coffee maker brewing, the warmth of a cup in our hands. We believe every coffee tells a story, and ours is born from the desire to make every sip a special moment.
We select our beans with care, work with committed producers, and focus on quality in every detail. Whether you visit us in person or enjoy our products from home, we want you to experience what moves us so much: the joy of enjoying coffee, however you like it.
Welcome to our coffee community. â˜•</div>
